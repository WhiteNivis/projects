The superstition allegedly stems from Asian culture, with numerous locations around the world including Korea and China believing in versions of it. The theory went viral on TikTok in December 2022 leading up to Christmas as users shared their experiences with the superstition and urged users not to get shoes for their partners, often while lip dubbing ""Mariners apartment complex"" by Lana Del Rey.","The idea of shoes being bad luck as gifts has been shared online throughout the 2000s and is linked to several cultures. In October 2009, the superstition was shared on superstitionsonline.com.[1] That year, a myLot[2] user from the Philippines shared a story about the superstition. Times Malta[3] and gone2korea[4] published pieces about the theory in 2010 and Dumpling Connection[5] published an article sharing the theory in 2019, writing:","Shoes are considered to be evil in Chinese culture because the word for ‚Äòshoe‚Äô in Mandarin sounds similar to the word for ‚Äòevil‚Äô.

The album inspired numerous memes and reactions and was removed from streaming platforms hours after its release. R. Kelly denied recording the music, claiming the voice on the album is not his.

The documents revealed the process of how the suppression was purportedly installed and pointed at possible drivers behind the decision, including many of Twitter's staff, with the following installments of the Twitter Files shedding light on visibility filtering on Twitter and on the decisionmaking process behind the ""Donald Trump's "":https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/donald-trump suspension following the January 6th, 2021, Capitol attack. The leak prompted viral discussions of freedom of speech on social media and widespread controversy.",,"On October 14th, 2020, the New York Post[1] published an article titled, ""Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad,"" in which emails allegedly sent between Joe Biden's son Hunter and a Ukrainian businessman were released. The article also included several photographs of Hunter Biden allegedly sourced from the hard drive, including pictures of him shirtless, smoking cigarettes and sleeping with a glass pipe hanging from his mouth.    That day, journalist Yashar Ali tweeted that Twitter was blocking users from posting a link to the NY Post story in both tweets and direct messages, purportedly suppressing the spread of the story. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany had notably been locked out of her account for posting a tweet about it.[2] Later that day, the official @TwitterSafety feed published a series of tweets explaining the company's reasoning for censoring the NY Post story, claiming it violated a policy that ""prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization."" The Twitter Files Two years later, on December 2nd, 2022 (notably after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter), journalist Matt Taibbi released screenshots of internal communications between high-ranking Twitter management on October 14th, 2020, which purportedly shed light on decision-making at the company that day. The documents, obtained by sources at Twitter and provided to journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss, contained emails in which Twitter management discussed measures taken by the company that day and the reasoning behind them. The release, made in a 37-tweet-long thread,[3] started with Matt Taibbi discussing Twitter deleting tweets allegedly at the behest of political parties, and, due to ""Twitter [being] overwhelmingly staffed by people of one political orientation,"" there were more ways to complain openly to the Democrats than to the Republicans, resulting in a ""slant in content moderation decisions.""     Further in the thread, Taibbi summarized the measures purportedly implemented by Twitter to suppress the spread of the New Your Post story, which was marked as violating Twitter's ""Hacked Materials"" policy, and published several emails sent by high-ranking officials on October 14th, 2020. In one of the leaked emails, communications official Trenton Kennedy writes,[4] ‚ÄúI'm struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this as unsafe‚Äù (shown below, left). In another email,[5] former Trust and safety chief Yoel Roth cited ""lessons of 2016"" as one of the reasons for suppressing the spread of the story (shown below, right).     More emails leaked by @mtabbi revealed a conversation between Twitter and the research firm NetChoice, in which NetChoice quoted Congress officials saying ""tech is screwed and rightfully so"" and reported that the Democratic party wanted social media to have more moderation.[6][7] The first tweet in the thread received over 130,000 retweets and 376,000 views in five days, and the Twitter Files were widely covered by mass media in the following days. Developments Twitter Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker Fired On December 6th, 2022, Twitter Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker was fired[8] by Twitter CEO Elon Musk for his role in the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story ‚Äî with some notably purporting that Musk was unaware of Baker's role in his company prior to his dismissal.[16] It was later revealed that Baker, a former FBI attorney, was involved in reviewing the Twitter files before they were sent to Taibbi and Weiss. Twitter Files Supplemental On December 6th, 2022, Matt Taibbi posted another Twitter Files thread in which he reported the firing of Jim Baker and disclosed that Baker was the person in charge of releasing the Twitter Files (shown below).[9]    In the thread, Taibbi wrote that the next installment of The Twitter Files would be published on Twitter by journalist Bari Weiss.[10] The same day, investigative journalist Lee Fang highlighted[15] that James Baker was allegedly involved in assisting the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign's operatives in spreading fabricated evidence against her competitor Donald Trump (tweet shown below).    Twitter Files Parts 2-5 On December 8th, Bari Weiss released[17] the second part of the Twitter Files, dedicated to ""Twitter's secret blacklists.""  A new #TwitterFiles investigation reveals that teams of Twitter employees build blacklists, prevent disfavored tweets from trending, and actively limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics--all in secret, without informing users.  On December 9th, 10th and 12th, journalists Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger and Bari Weiss released parts three,[18] four[19] and five[20] of Twitter Files on Twitter, all revealing internal communications during the January 6th, 2021, Storming of the United States Capitol and in the days that followed, the events which ultimately resulted in Twitter suspending president Donald J. Trump on January 8th. The documents revealed that Twitter employees organized[21] to demand their employer ban Trump, with Twitter executives banning Trump despite key staffers not being able to confirm that Trump did incite violence.[21]     Online Reactions The Twitter Files became a major topic in early December 2022 as it was widely covered in the media, with The New York Times,[11] The Washington Post[12] and other news outlets reporting on the story. On social media, the release of the Twitter Files was followed by viral debates, with users expressing various opinions on the matter and demanding accountability from those involved (example tweets shown below).     On December 4th, YouTuber[13] Asmongold also uploaded a video about the Twitter Files, which received over 363,000 views on YouTube in four days (shown below).  On December 7th, 2022, following the news of James Baker's involvement in reviewing the Twitter Files, Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey urged[14] Elon Musk to ""release everything without filter.""

Most likely due to his mental disabilities, eduardomajin4 never elaborated on the term and left it up for speculation. In late 2020, ""AIOPM"" started to be referenced in accordance with TikToker bandit.huncho. For instance, on December 18th, 2020, TikToker[3] guccifamousjoshfan posted a compilation of bandit.huncho videos and used ""#aiopm"" in the description, earning roughly 104,200 plays and 16,700 likes in two years (shown below).    @guccifamousjoshfan What Are Are You Choosing? #aiopm #hunchohop #hunchotwerk #woo ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Huncho Gucci Gang!

He grew a cult following throughout 2020 and 2021 for various arcs in his channel's history including running for President of the United States, the fog on his camera disappearing and reappearing, his obsession with pop singer Grace Vanderwaal, as well as his multiple bans due to NSFW nudity on livestreams.  Joshua Block / World Of T-Shirts World Of T-Shirts or WorldOfTshirts is the social media handle of online comedian and personality Joshua Block, as well as the name of his online T-shirt store. Block gained significant notoriety on TikTok around October 2020 for his comedy videos, live streams and vlogs, particularly for his eccentric, extroverted and naturally entertaining personality. Block has been criticized for charging his fans to take pictures and videos with him. In May 2021, Block paid to have a billboard in Times Square display him dancing along with his TikTok handle.  Brent Peterson Brent Peterson (@brent1330metalfunk) is a West Virginia-based TikToker most known for his bait-and-switch stitches in which he states that he's running for President of the United States in 2024 while using a low-quality phone camera and multiple TikTok filters.

It was founded in the 1970s by Ra√´l, formerly known as Claude Vorilhon, and is centered on the belief that a technologically advanced species called the Elohim created humanity. The religion supposedly had tens of thousands of members at its peak and has been met with some controversy for its former symbol, resulting in the symbol being changed in the 1990s to a Star of David with swirling inward lines. In December 2022, Ye notably posted the original symbol to Twitter after spreading antisemitic ideas during his appearance on Infowars, resulting in his second ban from the platform.","The new religious movement Ra√´lism began on September 19th, 1974, in Auvergne, France when Claude Vorilhon, known as Ra√´l, published his book, Le Livre Qui Dit La Verit√©.[1] In the book, Ra√´l claims he was contacted by a technologically advanced alien race known as the Elohim in 1973, who supposedly created humans. Originally, Rael started the organization MADECH to promote the ideas given to him by the aliens but changed this to the Ra√´lian Church in 1976. As they gained followers, the movement relocated from France to Quebec, Canada.","According to Ra√´lism, the Elohim have been mistaken for gods all throughout history, claiming that figures including Jesus, Buddha and Muhammed are human-Elohim hybrids sent to earth to spread the news of their origins.[2] They also believe that the bombing of Hiroshima ushered the world into an ""Age of Apocalypse"" where the earth is under constant threat of nuclear apocalypse. Ra√´lism states it is ultimately a religion based on peace that says humanity must harness new technology for peaceful purposes, upon which the Elohim will come to earth and share their technological advancements with the human race.  On Rael.org, the religion's official website, they boast support for things including the ""free the nipple"" movement, defending minorities, machine workers and reclaiming the swastika as a symbol of peace.[4]  Ra√´lian Symbol The original Ra√´lian symbol, seen as a symbol of infinity, is made up of a swastika inside of a Star of David (shown below, left). It is often worn around the necks of the religion's followers. According to Ra√´l, the symbol was seen on the outside hull of the Elohim's spaceship, and it is said that the symbol helps followers of Raelism facilitate telepathic contact with the Elohim. In 1990, the symbol was updated to replace the swastika with a swirl by Rael allegedly at the request of the Elohim, in an effort to increase relations with Israel and show respect for holocaust victims (shown below, right). The swirl is meant to represent the swirling galaxy.[7][8]     Human Clone Eve In 2022, the Ra√´lian Church claimed to have produced the first human clone, named Eve.[3] The claims were met with disbelief by many. 60 Minutes produced a report on this claim, which was posted to YouTube in 2021, garnering over 250,000 views in a year (shown below).  Online Presence Memes The Ra√´lian symbol has been the subject of memes throughout the 2010s for its bizarre juxtaposition between a swastika and the Star of David, often seen as two polar-opposite symbols. For example, on November 12th, 2019, a meme was posted to /r/HistoryMemes[5] using the symbol, garnering over 47,900 upvotes in three years (shown below, left). On June 17th, 2020, a meme was posted to /r/PoliticalCompassMemes[6] using the symbol, garnering over 3,100 upvotes in two years (shown below, right).     Kanye Posts The Ra√´lian Symbol On December 1st, 2022, after making an appearance on Alex Jones' show Infowars where Kanye made several antisemitic claims, he posted a screenshot of a Photoshop window with the symbol showing, writing, ""YE24."" The project file is also named, ""YE24,"" suggesting he may be using the symbol to promote his purported 2024 presidential run.    That day, Ye shared texts between himself and Elon Musk where Musk told him that posting the symbol went ""too far,"" writing, ""this is not love"" (shown below). Ye pushed back against Musk's claim but Musk banned him from Twitter shortly after.

The term is typically used to refer to one's opponents, with the common understanding being that the term ""opp"" stems from the word ""opposition."" The abbreviation grew in prevalence online in the late 2010s, with a slew of Chicago rappers and Chief Keef, in particular, helping to popularize the term after the year 2016.","According to Genius,[1] the earliest use of the word ""opposition"" in a rap song was in a 1985 track named ""Rock The Bells"" by rapper LL Cool J, where he says, ""Be forced to assault / Opposition will halt"" (seen below, left).[2] Another early use of the word ""opposition"" stems from the Dr. Dre song ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'"" where he says, ""But I ain't no politician, no competition / Sending all opposition to see a mortician"" (seen below, right).[3]","However, the earliest known use of the abbreviation ""opp"" stems from a more recent song by Chicago-based drill artist Chief Keef, in his 2011 track ""John Madden,"" in which he says, ""Better stop, fuck nigga we don't fuck with opps (Nah)."" The track can be accessed via upload to YouTube from October 30th, 2011,[4] where it gathered over 16 million views in 11 years (seen below).   Spread Other early uses of the word ""opp"" stem from Lil Reese, Chief Keef's contemporary at the time, in his track ""Us,"" in which he says, ""Fuck a opp, we send shots."" The track can be accessed via an April 4th, 2012, video uploaded to the YouTube[5] channel A Zae Production, where it gathered over 14 million views in 10 years (seen below, left). Chief Keef uses the word ""opp"" again in his track ""Citgo,"" which was uploaded to the YouTube[6] channel Homespun Media Group on August 15, 2013, where it gathered over 30 million views in nine years (seen below, right).     Use of the term ""opp"" in rap music remained largely minimal until 2016, after which the word exploded into popularity, primarily due to the increased virality of the Chicago drill music scene Chief Keef pioneered. Various rap artists like Travis Scott, [7] Playboi Carti, [8] Lil Uzi Vert [9] and others popularized the term in the latter half of the 2010s. The use of the word ""opp"" also entered mainstream slang during the late 2010s, with the earliest viral uses of the term appearing in 2018. Playboi Carti,[10] Lil Durk,[11] Cardi B[12] and Young Thug[13] notably tweeted using the word ""opp"" in 2018.

Sneako began posting to YouTube in 2013 and gained a significant following throughout the late 2010s for content including man-on-the-street segments like ""Would You Say the N-word for 1 Dollar"" and ""Why Men and Women Aren't Equal."" He also started a second channel, ""One Minute Podcast,"" where he would ask people for hot takes on often controversial subjects in public. Throughout the 2020s and during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sneako's content became increasingly controversial and was perceived as sexist, antisemitic and hateful by many. He also started to associate with figures like Andrew Tate, Tristan Tate and Nick Fuentes. In October 2022, his YouTube account was then terminated. In November, he met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago alongside Kanye West and Fuentes, who he also went to InfoWars with in December.","Sneako was born on September 8th, 1998, describing his upbringing as middle class, and attended private school during his youth. Sneako posted his first video to his now-deleted YouTube channel on April 9th, 2013. The majority of his early content featured Sneako ranting while playing video games like Call of Duty. Sneako claims he got his first YouTube AdSense check when he was 14 years old. In November 2015, Sneako uploaded a video titled ""How People View You,"" a motivational video where he talks about people's perceptions while cutting his hair. This was his first viral video (reupload shown below).[1][2]","After the success of the video, Sneako largely stopped making gaming content and started posting rants and videos about cultural, political and motivational topics. Sneako also became friends with MrBeast, who was purportedly a fan of his content. Sneako worked with MrBeast in 2018 but was fired after working on a single YouTube[3] video, ""I Built A Working Car Using Only LEGOS,"" leading to their falling out (shown below).   One Minute Podcast After the falling out with MrBeast in 2018, Sneako began the series ""One Minute Podcast,"" where he set up a table in public spaces and asked random passersby their opinions on controversial opinions, such as, ""do white lives matter?"" (reupload shown below).[1]  ""We Broke Up"" Video / D'angelo Wallace Feud In early 2021, Sneako uploaded a video titled ""We broke up"" to YouTube[4] where he interviews his ex-girlfriend and talked with her about why she broke up with him (reupload shown below). The two were in an open relationship but his ex-girlfriend seems unsure of that fact in the video. She says they broke up because of distance and because he cheated on her. Some commenters thought the video crossed a line and was too personal.  YouTuber D'Angelo Wallace commented under the video, ""he's for the streets."" Shortly after the comment, Sneako uploaded a video to YouTube[5] titled ""FORCING MYSELF TO WATCH D'ANGELO WALLACE"" in which he rants against Wallace while watching his video ""Influencer-19,"" where Wallace criticizes influencers for publically partying during the COVID-19 pandemic (reupload shown below). In the video, he makes fun of Wallace, derogatorily calls him gay and says Wallace is just jealous he wasn't invited to the parties. Prior to the video in late 2020, Sneako had made numerous tweets[6][7] downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic. D'Angelo never responded to Sneako's response. On March 18th, 2021, YouTuber Kuncan Dastner posted a video detailing the feud.  Sneako Cucked By Ex-Girlfriend In November 2021, Sneako appeared on the YouTube[8] podcast Peer to Peer Podcast and talked about his open relationship with his girlfriend. During the podcast, he describes a situation where he was cucked by his girlfriend, saying it felt like ""somebody was taking something"" from him as he watched her have sex with another man (shown below). Some people have joked and hypothesized that this contributed to his increasingly sexist opinions.  Reaction Content / Andrew Tate Throughout 2022, Sneako started delving more into livestreaming and reaction content. He also grew a liking for Andrew Tate and would frequently react to his content and parrot his claims on his second channel, SHNEAKO, where he posted most of his reaction content (now deleted). Sneako started to grow a following on TikTok[9] for compilation videos similar to those posted by Tate fans where he makes controversial, often sexist claims about women (examples shown below). He also started to regularly make fun of content creators with liberal beliefs.    @heartonmysleeve_ Sneako seen it all #prediction #sneako #fyp ‚ô¨ Can We Kiss Forever? ‚Äì Kina       @sneako_page üëá How Much Money Should a Gey make per Year? #sneako #sneakoclips #shneako #shneakoclips ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì SNEAKO      Chad Chad Controversy In mid-2022, Sneako reacted to a video by creator Chad Chad. During the stream, he makes fun of Chad Chad's looks and blames her feminist viewpoints on the assumption that she hasn't had sex in a long time, making mock humping motions and a choking motion as he says, ""shut up with your feminist viewpoints.""  Sneako inspired controversy for the motions he made, with some saying they implied sexual assault. Sneako defended himself by calling the claims ""kink-shaming,"" saying that he likes rough sex and that he said she needs that, not that he wants to do it to her. The Creativity Kit In 2022, Sneako started a business called ""The Creativity Kit""[10] that has been compared to Andrew Tate's ""Hustlers University."" Essentially, The Creativity Kit offered paying members access to a course on how to make money online. YouTuber BSOLZ posted a video in August 2022 where he tries the Creativity Kit, criticizing it, garnering over 128,000 views in a year (shown below).  YouTube Channel Termination and Move to Rumble By September 2022, Sneako had two strikes on his YouTube channel. He began reacting to increasingly controversial, right-wing media figures, including people like Tucker Carlson, Steven Crowder and Nick Fuentes, also reacting to the documentary What Is A Woman. He also started creating content with Fuentes, inviting him on his stream where he pushed back against none of his anti-semitic or racist claims. On October 3rd, he was banned from YouTube.[11] On October 19th, he appeared on YouTube[12] on No Jumper with Fuentes to have a ""race debate"" (shown below).  Following his ban from YouTube, Sneako moved his livestreams and content to Rumble.[13] 2022 Mar-a-Lago Visit On November 25th, 2022, Sneako posted a photograph to Twitter[14] where he is seen with Kanye West and Milo Yiannopoulos before their visit with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago (shown below).    Feud With Cr1TiKaL In early November 2022, Sneako went on stream (shown below, left) to defend the hosts of the Fresh & Fit podcast after Cr1TiKaL posted a video making fun of a story they told on their show (shown below, right).[16][17]     On November 25th,  Cr1TiKaL posted a video to YouTube[18] where he discusses how Sneako has been criticizing him. In the video, he makes fun of Sneako for being sensitive. In particular, he shows clips of Sneako defending the movie Cuties after Cr1TiKal made a video denouncing it for its sexualization of children and shows clips of him talking about getting cucked.  Online Presence Sneako is currently active on Twitter[15] @TheSNEAKO and Rumble at sneakouniverse. Retrospectives / Calls for Ban Throughout 2022, YouTubers posted numerous videos calling for Sneako to be banned from the platform and making videos explaining how he had been delving more and more into controversial topics (examples shown below).

The slideshows became a clich√© on the platform as people either found them cringy or relatable and made parodies of them that used more obtuse or aggressive clips and soundbites. Phrases like Slideshows Boutta Go Crazy or Slideshows Gonna Be Crazy started trending in anticipation of the sound's usage by depressed others.

There were no signs of forced entry and it is believed that the killing was a targeted attack. The investigation is ongoing and the murderer(s) have not been caught, with no suspects named by police as of November 30th. As the investigation went on, online sleuths, especially on Reddit and 4chan, began examining the evidence and attempting to dig up new leads to solve the crime. Some believe the murderer posted on Instagram under the name the_moscow_slayer and that they posted a photo of Goncalves to 4chan on the day of the killings. The photo is seemingly taken from outside a window in Moscow, Idaho and shows a girl's hair that some believe is Gonclaves, although these claims are unconfirmed.",,"On November 14th, FOX News[2] reported that the town's Mayor, Art Bettge, hypothesized, ""It‚Äôs one of any of a plenitude of possibilities, including burglary gone wrong, robbery gone wrong ‚Ä¶ any of those is a possibility and not one to the exclusion of others."" This was later found to be unlikely, as police believe it was a targeted attack.   Developments / Investigation November 14th, 2022 (Stabbing, Isolated Attack) On November 14th, 2022, FOX News[3] reported that the students were stabbed to death according to authorities. The report claims that no weapons were found on the scene, but they believe a knife was used. The report also shared a group photo of the four victims reportedly taken hours before the murders (shown below). Police believed it was an ""isolated and targeted attack"" and that the murderer or murderers are not a threat to the community.    November 15th and 16th, 2022 (Blood Oozing Through Walls, Press Conference) On November 15th, 2022, the Daily Mail[4] reported that the attack was so brutal that blood was left ""oozing through the walls"" of the home. One police source told the Daily Mail that it was ""the worst they‚Äôve ever seen,"" saying, ""We have investigators who have been on the job for 20, even 30, years, and they say they have never seen anything like this."" The report also gives details of the investigation, sharing that police were going through trash cans close to the home to look for potential weapons and that Chapin's body was found on the second floor of the three-floor home. On November 16th, The New York Times[5] reported that the police had no suspect and shared photos of a candlelight vigil held for the students. That day, police gave a press conference giving all available details of the investigation up to that date (shown below). During the conference, Moscow Police Chief James Fry claimed that Chapin and Kernodle were at a party before they were murdered and Mogen and Goncalves were at a bar. Chapin did not live in the house but was visiting his girlfriend, Kernodle. There were two other roommates at the house when police arrived on the scene who were uninjured. Fry is unsure why the caller reported an unconscious individual rather than a quadruple murder. A reporter asked if the roommates witnessed the murder and Fry responded, ""I‚Äôm not going to go into what they shared."" The roommates were all allegedly part of ""Greek life on campus.""

Between 2:44 and 2:52 a.m., Mogen reportedly called Jack three times. Kaylee allegedly called the man one more time at 2:53 a.m. Allegedly, this is Goncalves' ex-boyfriend and the Goncalves family is certain he was not the murderer.[19] That day, CNN[9] shared a video taken of two of the four victims, Mogen and Goncalves, at a food truck on the night of the murders at around 1:41 a.m. The food truck owner, Joseph Woodall, claimed they did not seem distressed in any way.  That day, ABC News[10] reported that the two surviving roommates were not believed to be the murderers. Allegedly, they slept through the murders, a fact that some Idaho police found hard to believe.[20] They also shared a map from the City of Moscow Police department offering a timeline of the whereabouts of the four students hours before the murders (shown below).

The coroner reported that they were stabbed in the chest and upper body and there were no signs of sexual assault. On November 20th, ABC News[12] reported that ""other friends"" were in the house when the 911 call was made to the police at around 11:58 a.m., but they did not say how many. The call was reportedly made from one of the surviving roommates' phones. The surviving roommates were still not considered suspects.

Wills also discouraged people from ""spreading rumors"" about the case, including about suspects who have been ruled out. On November 23rd, Global News[15] published an article sharing a message from the police dispelling rumors that Goncalves was being stalked. They also dispel a rumor that a skinned dog found three weeks before the killings was related to the crime, the police saying it was more likely caused by wildlife. November 23rd to November 30th, 2022 On November 27th, 2022, ABC Chicago[16] released a summary of the investigation so far. On November 29th, ABC 6[17] reported that the father of Goncalves called on the public for help solving the case. On November 30th, the New York Post[18] reported that Jeremy Reagan, a ""socially awkward"" law student at U of I, denied claims that he was the murderer after people online allegedly started spreading the rumor. Online Reactions The case inspired condolences for the victims and calls for the murderers to be found. It also inspired a lot of internet sleuthing and hypothesizing as people poured over the evidence and searched for new leads on the case. Some people hurled accusations at potential suspects, including Goncalves' ex-boyfriend Jack, who Goncalves called six times shortly before the murder. Goncalves' family believes he is innocent (shown below, left). Amateur crime reporters and creators also gave summaries and opinions on the case, including Law & Crime Network (shown below, right).     4chan Posts On November 27th, 2022, an anonymous user of 4chan's /pol/[22] board began a ""University of Idaho Murder General"" thread in order to discuss the case and collect evidence relating to it.

One post from November 20th shared on the thread claims that the street where Showalter lives was closed off at one point. None of these claims are confirmed and may be false leads.     /r/IdahoMurders Subreddit The /r/IdahoMurders subreddit was created on November 17th, 2022, to discuss the ongoing investigation and is largely used to share potential leads on the case. The forum gained over 27,000 followers by November 30th. Some of the forum's top posts share disgust with some of the rumors and hypotheses being spread online and discourage amateur sleuths from jumping to conclusions.[23][24] On November 26th, a Redditor made a post on /r/IdahoMurders[25] claiming they saw two photos on 4chan the day of the murders ‚Äî one of which they believe is Kaylee Goncalve in her bedroom taken from either outside the window or from in a closet. The other is all black as if taken in the dark. The user provides screenshots of the photos (shown below). One photo is labeled ""Step one."" One poster claims the anon posted the photos with weird messages the night of the murder along with coordinates that lead to a location near the crime scene. These reports are all unconfirmed and possibly unrelated to the case or fake.
