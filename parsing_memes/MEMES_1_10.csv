The superstition allegedly stems from Asian culture, with numerous locations around the world including Korea and China believing in versions of it. The theory went viral on TikTok in December 2022 leading up to Christmas as users shared their experiences with the superstition and urged users not to get shoes for their partners, often while lip dubbing ""Mariners apartment complex"" by Lana Del Rey.","The idea of shoes being bad luck as gifts has been shared online throughout the 2000s and is linked to several cultures.

Times Malta[3] and gone2korea[4] published pieces about the theory in 2010 and Dumpling Connection[5] published an article sharing the theory in 2019, writing:","Shoes are considered to be evil in Chinese culture because the word for ‚Äòshoe‚Äô in Mandarin sounds similar to the word for ‚Äòevil‚Äô.

The article also included several photographs of Hunter Biden allegedly sourced from the hard drive, including pictures of him shirtless, smoking cigarettes and sleeping with a glass pipe hanging from his mouth.    That day, journalist Yashar Ali tweeted that Twitter was blocking users from posting a link to the NY Post story in both tweets and direct messages, purportedly suppressing the spread of the story. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany had notably been locked out of her account for posting a tweet about it.[2] Later that day, the official @TwitterSafety feed published a series of tweets explaining the company's reasoning for censoring the NY Post story, claiming it violated a policy that ""prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization."" The Twitter Files Two years later, on December 2nd, 2022 (notably after Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter), journalist Matt Taibbi released screenshots of internal communications between high-ranking Twitter management on October 14th, 2020, which purportedly shed light on decision-making at the company that day. The documents, obtained by sources at Twitter and provided to journalists Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss, contained emails in which Twitter management discussed measures taken by the company that day and the reasoning behind them. The release, made in a 37-tweet-long thread,[3] started with Matt Taibbi discussing Twitter deleting tweets allegedly at the behest of political parties, and, due to ""Twitter [being] overwhelmingly staffed by people of one political orientation,"" there were more ways to complain openly to the Democrats than to the Republicans, resulting in a ""slant in content moderation decisions.""     Further in the thread, Taibbi summarized the measures purportedly implemented by Twitter to suppress the spread of the New Your Post story, which was marked as violating Twitter's ""Hacked Materials"" policy, and published several emails sent by high-ranking officials on October 14th, 2020. In one of the leaked emails, communications official Trenton Kennedy writes,[4] ‚ÄúI'm struggling to understand the policy basis for marking this as unsafe‚Äù (shown below, left). In another email,[5] former Trust and safety chief Yoel Roth cited ""lessons of 2016"" as one of the reasons for suppressing the spread of the story (shown below, right).     More emails leaked by @mtabbi revealed a conversation between Twitter and the research firm NetChoice, in which NetChoice quoted Congress officials saying ""tech is screwed and rightfully so"" and reported that the Democratic party wanted social media to have more moderation.[6][7] The first tweet in the thread received over 130,000 retweets and 376,000 views in five days, and the Twitter Files were widely covered by mass media in the following days. Developments Twitter Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker Fired On December 6th, 2022, Twitter Deputy General Counsel Jim Baker was fired[8] by Twitter CEO Elon Musk for his role in the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story ‚Äî with some notably purporting that Musk was unaware of Baker's role in his company prior to his dismissal.[16] It was later revealed that Baker, a former FBI attorney, was involved in reviewing the Twitter files before they were sent to Taibbi and Weiss. Twitter Files Supplemental On December 6th, 2022, Matt Taibbi posted another Twitter Files thread in which he reported the firing of Jim Baker and disclosed that Baker was the person in charge of releasing the Twitter Files (shown below).[9]    In the thread, Taibbi wrote that the next installment of The Twitter Files would be published on Twitter by journalist Bari Weiss.[10] The same day, investigative journalist Lee Fang highlighted[15] that James Baker was allegedly involved in assisting the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign's operatives in spreading fabricated evidence against her competitor Donald Trump (tweet shown below).

A new #TwitterFiles investigation reveals that teams of Twitter employees build blacklists, prevent disfavored tweets from trending, and actively limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics--all in secret, without informing users.  On December 9th, 10th and 12th, journalists Matt Taibbi, Michael Shellenberger and Bari Weiss released parts three,[18] four[19] and five[20] of Twitter Files on Twitter, all revealing internal communications during the January 6th, 2021, Storming of the United States Capitol and in the days that followed, the events which ultimately resulted in Twitter suspending president Donald J. Trump on January 8th. The documents revealed that Twitter employees organized[21] to demand their employer ban Trump, with Twitter executives banning Trump despite key staffers not being able to confirm that Trump did incite violence.[21]     Online Reactions The Twitter Files became a major topic in early December 2022 as it was widely covered in the media, with The New York Times,[11] The Washington Post[12] and other news outlets reporting on the story. On social media, the release of the Twitter Files was followed by viral debates, with users expressing various opinions on the matter and demanding accountability from those involved (example tweets shown below).     On December 4th, YouTuber[13] Asmongold also uploaded a video about the Twitter Files, which received over 363,000 views on YouTube in four days (shown below).

Around early 2020, this sexy outfit became a popular subgenre in online illustrations for bunny suits and one of the most popular costumes in the hentai subcultures, with the help of Bunny Day, an unofficial holiday that established its concept on the internet in the late 2010s. Later, this fictional outfit materialized in real life and became popular in cosplays and the porn industry.","According to Pixiv Encyclopedia[1] and Nico Nico Pedia[2], similar ""reverse outfit"" ideas, which could be called ""Reverse Bikini Armours"" (ÈÄÜ„Éì„Ç≠„Éã„Ç¢„Éº„Éû„Éº)[3] or ""Reverse School Swimsuits"" (ÈÄÜ„Çπ„ÇØ„Éº„É´Ê∞¥ÁùÄ)[4], could be found in hentai mangas after the 1980s and online illustrations after the 2000s. The online glossaries also point out that a 1997 hentai comic, ""Bizarre Daimajutsu"" (BIZARREÂ§ßÈ≠îË°ì) by Mitsunari Tenpuu (Â§©È¢®ÂÖâÊàê), is the earliest instance of the reverse bunny suit.","Meanwhile, a handful of artists had already posted the reverse bunny suits illustrations to Twitter and Pixiv by the middle of 2019. The oldest one on Pixiv was published by Onakaitai on August 14th, 2014.[5] On Twitter, Japanese mangaka Shake-O (ÈÆ≠Â§´)[6] has posted rabbit girls wearing reverse bunny suits since 2016 (shown below). Also, illustrator and anime background art designer NYAGORO posted Ryuka Shimizudani from the Japanese manga Saki[7] in a reverse bunny suit in 2018. His tweet with the illustration, drawn in the drawing chat on Futaba Channel (2chan), suggested 2chan users hadn't been familiar with the idea of this outfit in that period.[8]    The online presence of reverse bunny suits began increasing around early 2020. At that time, people noticed some online artists posting the illustrations around on November 28th (11/28), December 8th (12/8), January 28th (1/28), February 8th (2/8), and March 28th (3/28) (shown below). Their works got inspired by ""Reverse Bunny Day,"" the unofficial holiday for the outfit which read the numbers of ""Bunny Day"" (8/2, 8/21, or 8/23) backward or referred to November 28th as ""Good Reverse Bunny Day"" in a similar way to ""Good Knee-High Socks Day"".     Early works posted around Reverse Bunny days till February 2020  Spread Throughout those unofficial anniversary days between the end of 2019 and early 2020, Reverse Bunny Suits gained high visibility on Twitter around the spring of 2020. That year's 3rd celebration on March 28th received much more reaction from Twitter users than in previous years. As its popularity grew on the social networking service, illustrators voluntarily began using censorship to hide nipples and crotch in the illustrations in a concern for community guideline violations or a shadowban[9] from the SNS. This slightly changed version came to the de-facto standard of the costume on Twitter[10], Nico Nico Seiga[11], and other online services that don't allow hentai artworks. On October 31st, 2020, the Japanese TV anime for the light novel How Not to Summon a Demon Lord[12] celebrated Halloween on Twitter with an illustration by Takahiro Tsurusaki (È∂¥Â¥éË≤¥Â§ß)[13], the illustrator for the light novel series, in which the anime's heroines are wearing reverse bunny suits in this format.[14] Pixiv had nearly 5,000 illustrations for this fetish costume only that year, and its amount had increased to about 10,000 by December 2022[15], in which almost 75% of the submissions were R-18. Cosplay costume makers started releasing reverse bunny suits in the latter half of 2020. Porn video makers soon introduced the costume into their works and have made it one of the most popular costumes in the Japanese porn industry since the following year. According to the Japanese e-commerce site for adult content, Fanza, the number of porn videos featuring the costume was four in 2020, then increased to 37 in 2021 and nearly 150 in 2022.[16] It also became popular in the non-porn content by sexy models and cosplayers, which usually combined the outfit with swimsuits or lingerie. Japanese model Aoi Hinata (Êó•ÂêëËëµË°£)[17], who in a reverse bunny suit made an appearance in a weekly magazine released in December 2021, proclaimed herself the first gravure idol wearing the costume in commercial media by citing a publisher's testimony.[18] Various Examples       Search Interest     External References  [1] Pixiv Encyclopedia ‚Äì ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº [1] Nico Nico Pedia ‚Äì ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº [3] Pixiv Encyclopedia ‚Äì ÈÄÜ„Éì„Ç≠„Éã„Ç¢„Éº„Éû„Éº [4] Pixiv Encyclopedia ‚Äì ÈÄÜ„Çπ„ÇØÊ∞¥ [5] Pixiv ‚Äì ÂèçËª¢„Éê„Éã„Éº„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì / 08-14-2014 [NSFW!] [6] Wikipedia ‚Äì ÈÆ≠Â§´ (Japanese) [7] Wikipedia ‚Äì Saki [8] Twitter ‚Äì @nyagoro2001 / 03-19-2018 [9] Wikipedia ‚Äì Shadow banning [10] Twitter ‚Äì  ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº / #ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº [11] Nico Nico Seiga ‚Äì ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº (Japanese) [12] Wikipedia ‚Äì How Not to Summon a Demon Lord [13] Wikipedia ‚Äì È∂¥Â¥éË≤¥Â§ß (Japanese) [14] Twitter ‚Äì @isekaimaou / 10-31-2020 [15] Pixiv ‚Äì #ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº [16] Fanza ‚Äì Search results for ÈÄÜ„Éê„Éã„Éº (Japanese) [NSFW!] [17] Wikipedia ‚Äì Êó•ÂêëËëµË°£ (Japanese) [18] Instagram ‚Äì @aoi_hnta / 10-16-2022",

The slideshows became a clich√© on the platform as people either found them cringy or relatable and made parodies of them that used more obtuse or aggressive clips and soundbites. Phrases like Slideshows Boutta Go Crazy or Slideshows Gonna Be Crazy started trending in anticipation of the sound's usage by depressed others.

There were no signs of forced entry and it is believed that the killing was a targeted attack. The investigation is ongoing and the murderer(s) have not been caught, with no suspects named by police as of November 30th. As the investigation went on, online sleuths, especially on Reddit and 4chan, began examining the evidence and attempting to dig up new leads to solve the crime. Some believe the murderer posted on Instagram under the name the_moscow_slayer and that they posted a photo of Goncalves to 4chan on the day of the killings. The photo is seemingly taken from outside a window in Moscow, Idaho and shows a girl's hair that some believe is Gonclaves, although these claims are unconfirmed.",,"On November 14th, FOX News[2] reported that the town's Mayor, Art Bettge, hypothesized, ""It‚Äôs one of any of a plenitude of possibilities, including burglary gone wrong, robbery gone wrong ‚Ä¶ any of those is a possibility and not one to the exclusion of others."" This was later found to be unlikely, as police believe it was a targeted attack.   Developments / Investigation November 14th, 2022 (Stabbing, Isolated Attack) On November 14th, 2022, FOX News[3] reported that the students were stabbed to death according to authorities. The report claims that no weapons were found on the scene, but they believe a knife was used. The report also shared a group photo of the four victims reportedly taken hours before the murders (shown below). Police believed it was an ""isolated and targeted attack"" and that the murderer or murderers are not a threat to the community.    November 15th and 16th, 2022 (Blood Oozing Through Walls, Press Conference) On November 15th, 2022, the Daily Mail[4] reported that the attack was so brutal that blood was left ""oozing through the walls"" of the home. One police source told the Daily Mail that it was ""the worst they‚Äôve ever seen,"" saying, ""We have investigators who have been on the job for 20, even 30, years, and they say they have never seen anything like this."" The report also gives details of the investigation, sharing that police were going through trash cans close to the home to look for potential weapons and that Chapin's body was found on the second floor of the three-floor home. On November 16th, The New York Times[5] reported that the police had no suspect and shared photos of a candlelight vigil held for the students. That day, police gave a press conference giving all available details of the investigation up to that date (shown below). During the conference, Moscow Police Chief James Fry claimed that Chapin and Kernodle were at a party before they were murdered and Mogen and Goncalves were at a bar. Chapin did not live in the house but was visiting his girlfriend, Kernodle. There were two other roommates at the house when police arrived on the scene who were uninjured. Fry is unsure why the caller reported an unconscious individual rather than a quadruple murder. A reporter asked if the roommates witnessed the murder and Fry responded, ""I‚Äôm not going to go into what they shared."" The roommates were all allegedly part of ""Greek life on campus.""  November 17th, 2022 (/r/IdahoMurders, Pushback Against Police) On November 17th, 2022, the /r/idahomurders[6] subreddit was opened to discuss the case and dig up new leads and clues regarding it in an attempt to find the murderers. On that day, Global News[7] reported that police had been ""reticent"" on releasing info on the murder and that parents and family members of the victims were critical of the police force's efforts for sharing so little information. November 18th, 2022 (Calls to Ex-Boyfriend Jack, Food Truck Video, Surviving Roommates Cleared) On November 18th, 2022, Fox News[8] reported that Goncalves' sister, Alivea Goncalves, claimed that Kaylee called a man named Jack six times between 2:26 and 2:44 a.m. on the night she was murdered. Between 2:44 and 2:52 a.m., Mogen reportedly called Jack three times. Kaylee allegedly called the man one more time at 2:53 a.m. Allegedly, this is Goncalves' ex-boyfriend and the Goncalves family is certain he was not the murderer.[19] That day, CNN[9] shared a video taken of two of the four victims, Mogen and Goncalves, at a food truck on the night of the murders at around 1:41 a.m. The food truck owner, Joseph Woodall, claimed they did not seem distressed in any way.  That day, ABC News[10] reported that the two surviving roommates were not believed to be the murderers. Allegedly, they slept through the murders, a fact that some Idaho police found hard to believe.[20] They also shared a map from the City of Moscow Police department offering a timeline of the whereabouts of the four students hours before the murders (shown below). That day, TMZ[21] reported that Xana fought back against the attacker.    November 19th to the 21st, 2022 (Stabbed to Death In Beds, Calls to Police) On November 19th, 2022, Global News[11] reported that the victims were stabbed to death in their beds and were likely killed in their sleep, according to the county coroner. The coroner reported that they were stabbed in the chest and upper body and there were no signs of sexual assault. On November 20th, ABC News[12] reported that ""other friends"" were in the house when the 911 call was made to the police at around 11:58 a.m., but they did not say how many. The call was reportedly made from one of the surviving roommates' phones. The surviving roommates were still not considered suspects. On November 21st, CNN[13] released a timeline of the investigation so far. November 22nd and 23rd, 2022 (Police Dispel Stalking, Skinned Dog Rumors) On November 22nd, 2022, The Guardian[14] published an article about the fear that the lack of evidence surrounding the case was causing. In the article, they share a message from Police Colonel Kedrick Wills, who said, ""We know that people want answers. We want answers, too."" Wills also discouraged people from ""spreading rumors"" about the case, including about suspects who have been ruled out. On November 23rd, Global News[15] published an article sharing a message from the police dispelling rumors that Goncalves was being stalked. They also dispel a rumor that a skinned dog found three weeks before the killings was related to the crime, the police saying it was more likely caused by wildlife. November 23rd to November 30th, 2022 On November 27th, 2022, ABC Chicago[16] released a summary of the investigation so far. On November 29th, ABC 6[17] reported that the father of Goncalves called on the public for help solving the case. On November 30th, the New York Post[18] reported that Jeremy Reagan, a ""socially awkward"" law student at U of I, denied claims that he was the murderer after people online allegedly started spreading the rumor. Online Reactions The case inspired condolences for the victims and calls for the murderers to be found. It also inspired a lot of internet sleuthing and hypothesizing as people poured over the evidence and searched for new leads on the case. Some people hurled accusations at potential suspects, including Goncalves' ex-boyfriend Jack, who Goncalves called six times shortly before the murder. Goncalves' family believes he is innocent (shown below, left). Amateur crime reporters and creators also gave summaries and opinions on the case, including Law & Crime Network (shown below, right).     4chan Posts On November 27th, 2022, an anonymous user of 4chan's /pol/[22] board began a ""University of Idaho Murder General"" thread in order to discuss the case and collect evidence relating to it. The thread includes photographs of a man who goes by dylanmm26 on VSCO seen with one of the victims, screenshots from a now-deleted Instagram account called the_moscow_slayer who followed the victims and posted an image of a knife that some believe to be the murder weapon (shown below, left) and an anonymous 4chan post claiming the killer is named Jack Showalter (shown below, right). One post from November 20th shared on the thread claims that the street where Showalter lives was closed off at one point. None of these claims are confirmed and may be false leads.     /r/IdahoMurders Subreddit The /r/IdahoMurders subreddit was created on November 17th, 2022, to discuss the ongoing investigation and is largely used to share potential leads on the case. The forum gained over 27,000 followers by November 30th. Some of the forum's top posts share disgust with some of the rumors and hypotheses being spread online and discourage amateur sleuths from jumping to conclusions.[23][24] On November 26th, a Redditor made a post on /r/IdahoMurders[25] claiming they saw two photos on 4chan the day of the murders ‚Äî one of which they believe is Kaylee Goncalve in her bedroom taken from either outside the window or from in a closet. The other is all black as if taken in the dark. The user provides screenshots of the photos (shown below). One photo is labeled ""Step one."" One poster claims the anon posted the photos with weird messages the night of the murder along with coordinates that lead to a location near the crime scene. These reports are all unconfirmed and possibly unrelated to the case or fake.
