The album was reuploaded to YouTube[2] that day by PluggingFr, garnering over 327,000 views in three days (shown below).","The most notable tracks on the album are, ""I Admit It (I Did It), Pt. 1,"" ""I Admit It (I Did It), Pt. 2"" and ""I Admit It (I Did It), Pt. 3."" The songs were originally released to R. Kelly's SoundCloud in 2018 as a single 19-minute track but has since been deleted. The full track was reuploaded to YouTube[3] in July of that year, garnering over 2.6 million views in four years (shown below). The song's lyrics feature Kelly singing about his trial and allegations, including deflection and denial of some aspects of the conviction.[4]  I admit I fuck with all the ladies, that's both older and young ladies (ladies, yeah) But tell me how they call it pedophile because that shit is crazy (crazy) You may have your opinions, entitled to your opinions (opinions, opinions) But really am I supposed to go to jail or lose my career because of your opinion Yeah, go ahead and stone me, point your finger at me (stone me, yeah, yeah) Turn the world against me, but only God can mute me (against me, mute me)  Album Removal Hours after its release on December 9th, 2022, I Admit It was removed from streaming platforms. That day, Billboard[5] reported that while the album was credited as released by Legacy Recordings, presumably Sony Music’s Legacy Recordings, a representative for the label denied publishing the album. The label was also reportedly looking into how streaming platforms were given the album. The article goes on to claim that I Admit It was uploaded by distributor Ingrooves, a company owned by Universal Music Group. According to the article, Ingrooves severed ties with Real Talk Entertainment, who allegedly released the album under a sub-label called Legacy Recordings, sharing a name with Sony Music’s Legacy Recordings. TMZ[6] published an article that day sharing that R. Kelly denied recording the album. He was quoted as saying, ""I hope people recognized my voice and know that,"" suggesting it is not his voice on the album. Online Presence The album gained viral spread following its release on streaming platforms as many people believed it was a genuine release from R. Kelly. For example, on December 9th, 2022, Twitter[7] user @SaycheeseDGTL shared that the album was released, garnering over 65,000 likes in three days. Twitter[8] user @InfernoOmni posted a video where he reacts to a section of one of the songs, garnering over 9,300 likes in the same span of time (shown below).  nah r kelly can't be a real person pic.twitter.com/1KzUJf1Ovf — Omni ☕️ (@InfernoOmni) December 9, 2022   On December 11th, TikToker[9] @averagemusiclover911 posted a review of the album, giving it a 0/10, garnering over 846,000 views in a day (shown below, left).

In late 2022, the video trended due to the Brazilian Kid Dance Battles on TikTok that used the same song. TikTokers set the creepy video of the small Mbappé dancing to the song, satirically comparing it to a video of Brazilian footballer Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior dancing in the locker room.

The platform gained viral attention in December 2022 after gambling streamer Trainwreckstv announced that he'd become a non-owner advisor and non-exclusive broadcaster on the site. Shortly after the announcement, information surfaced that suggests Kick is a Stake.com project, a crypto gambling website that was banned from Twitch when Twitch banned gambling from the site in September 2022.","Kick.com, also available at kick.live, was opened sometime around October 2022 and started to gain a following in November of that year. For example, on November 19th, 2022, Twitter[1] user and Stake co-founder @StakeEddie shared a link to the site, advertising a $50,000 Stake giveaway. On November 30th, the /r/KickStreaming[2] subreddit was created, gaining over 110 members in a week. On December 3rd, the official Kick Twitter[8] account, @KickStreaming, posted a graphic teasing their move into beta testing (shown below).","Trainwreckstv Announces Partnership With Kick On December 5th, 2022, gambling streamer Trainwreckstv, one of the most prominent streamers on the site, posted a Twitlonger link to Twitter[3] announcing that he would be working with Kick as a ""non-owner advisor and non-exclusive broadcaster."" In the Twitlonger,[4] he claims that he was inspired to work with them after Twtich's purportedly repeated history of cutting streamers' pay. He wrote: Twitch takes the highest percentage split of any platform in the livestreaming world. At 50%, every streamer on Twitch will only receive $2.50 of each subscription, and less if they’re not in a first world country. I don’t believe it’s right to take such a high percentage of the work that a streamer does. Twitch does nearly no marketing for streamers, no discovery, and limited help in building their business. Those streamers only succeed from the blood, sweat, and time they put in themselves. Twitch’s only role is as a website host. Given their contribution, it is absurd that they take 50% of our income. He goes on to list a number of features Kick is rolling out in the near future, including 100 percent of all tips on the site going to streamers, no ambiguous bans, rules governing ethical gambling and ""a steady income based on hours watched and total viewers you stream to"" (full Twitlonger shown below). The tweet gained over 13,000 likes and 1,000 retweets in a day.    Trainwreckstv's announcement was reported on by sites including Dot Esports[5] and esports.gg[6] that day. It was also reported by Twitter[7] user and media personality @JakeSucky, garnering over 13,000 likes in a day. Online Presence Connection With Stake.com On December 5th, 2022, the day Trainwreckstv announced his move to the platform, Twitter[9] user @Coco_VLR posted screenshots offering evidence that Kick was created by the team behind Stake.com, a crypto gambling website. The prevalence of Stake and similar crypto casinos on Twitch played a large part in the site banning most forms of gambling. Stake was notably the site that Trainwreckstv played on. The post gained over 160 likes in a day. On December 6th, Dexerto[10] published an article examining claims that Kick is a project by the Stake team. In the article, they share the tweet by Stake's cofounder, a now-deleted post to /r/KickStreaming[11] sharing evidence that mods named ""CalebKick"" and ""CalebStake"" started the sub, an archive[12] proving this and an archived[13] job listing on Easygo looking to hire people to work on Kick that states, ""Kick.com is a new venture created by the founders of Easygo and Stake.com."" Reactions / Criticism Following Tranwreckstv's partnership announcement and claims that Kick is a venture of Stake, the platform and Trainwreckstv gained some criticism due to Stake's reputation among many as being a scam. On December 5th, 2022, Twitter[14] user @Gappy_V shared doubts that a streamer on the platform had over 150,000 concurrent viewers, garnering over 120 likes in a day. On December 6th, YouTuber Coffeezilla made a post on Twitter[15] suggesting Trainwreckstv is moving there because of the Stake connection, garnering over 10,000 likes in under a day (shown below).

Gen Alpha is predominantly identified as the first generation of humans to exist fully in the internet age and 21st century. In memes and internet humor, they are often referred to as iPad kids and made fun of for their supposed low attention spans.","Generation Alpha was named as such in reference to the first letter of the Greek alphabet which symbolically identified them as the first of their kind, as in, being the first generation of humans entirely born in the 21st century with the internet in tow.[1][2] Alphas are generally children of Millennial parents. ""Generation Alpha"" was coined by Australian social researchers Mark McCrindle and Ashley Fell in 2011.[2]","At their start, Generation Alpha was at 2.5 million births per week, and some of them will live to see the 22nd century.[2] They are also the first generation to have mass accessibility to screens. Australian social research company McCrindle[2] labeled it ""The great screen-age"" and called their access to said screens ""an unintentional global experiment."" As of December 2022, the oldest of Gen Alpha is roughly 12 years old.  Online Presence Australian social researcher Mark McCrindle first discussed Generation Alpha in 2011. In the years following, he started posting YouTube videos about the generation, like one video[3] uploaded on February 11th, 2013, that received roughly 85,100 views in nine years (shown below, left). McCrindle also starred in TED Talks in which he'd discuss Generation Alpha. For instance, on September 23rd, 2013, a YouTube video of a McCrindle TEDx Talk was uploaded to YouTube[4] in which he talked about Generation Alpha, earning roughly 22,700 views in nine years (shown below, right).     Mass awareness online of Generation Alpha predominantly manifested from 2019 onward with other TED Talks[5] emerging about Gen Alpha that year. Twitter users began referencing the generation in tweets that earned viral engagement.

On June 14th, 2020, Twitter[7] user ZillySqueaks posted a similar tweet reiterating the history of generational upheaval, earning roughly 8,800 likes in two years (shown below, right).     As awareness of Generation Alpha manifested in the early 2020s, memes and internet jokes about them appeared en masse. Early viral content about Generation Alpha surfaced on TikTok more than other platforms and was predominantly made by Zoomers and Millennials who imagined scenarios and skits related to the general fear of generational upheaval and the various ways in which Alphas would criticize the two prior generations. For instance, one of the earliest viral TikTok videos to reference Generation Alpha was uploaded on August 19th, 2020 by TikToker[8] jesssica.le. Presumably a Zoomer, TikToker jesssica.le discussed what Gen Z internet trends Gen Alpha would cringe at similarly to how Gen-Z cringed at various Millieniel trends. Over two years, the TikTok received roughly 115,000 plays and 42,700 likes (shown below, left). On February 26th, 2022, presumably Millennial TikToker[9] danakowalski posted a video that joked about Gen Alpha owning Gen Z in a scenario related to Cancel Culture, gaining roughly 102,700 plays and 29,100 likes in a year and a half (shown below, right).    @jesssica.le gen alpha will crush us #genalpha #genz #millennial #readySETgo ♬ original sound – jessica lê       @danakowalski Reply to @alizasebbag who is ready for boomers?!?!  #pov #comedy #upcycling ♬ Monkeys Spinning Monkeys – Kevin MacLeod & Kevin The Monkey     Less reactionary content about Gen Alpha surfaced in 2021.

They are also said to have a specific raspy cough and are associated with games like Roblox and Minecraft.

The videos have gained much notoriety on YouTube, garnering considerable amounts of views, and with some speculating they are being aimed at younger audiences using manipulation of YouTube algorithms and bots to generate video views. Many discussed how the videos could affect Gen Alpha.  Me When I Was A Baby Me When I Was A Baby, also known as Whimsical Little Creature, refers to videos of the TikTok account MaestreEnsinador1.

The videos often show the puppet flying and twirling, sometimes doing a little dance and sometimes undertaking mysterious rituals. Maestre Ensinador went viral in the fall of 2022 after a series of duets where people showed his videos to their younger siblings and tried to convince them that the puppet was them as a baby.

Around early 2020, this sexy outfit became a popular subgenre in online illustrations for bunny suits and one of the most popular costumes in the hentai subcultures, with the help of Bunny Day, an unofficial holiday that established its concept on the internet in the late 2010s. Later, this fictional outfit materialized in real life and became popular in cosplays and the porn industry.","According to Pixiv Encyclopedia[1] and Nico Nico Pedia[2], similar ""reverse outfit"" ideas, which could be called ""Reverse Bikini Armours"" (逆ビキニアーマー)[3] or ""Reverse School Swimsuits"" (逆スクール水着)[4], could be found in hentai mangas after the 1980s and online illustrations after the 2000s. The online glossaries also point out that a 1997 hentai comic, ""Bizarre Daimajutsu"" (BIZARRE大魔術) by Mitsunari Tenpuu (天風光成), is the earliest instance of the reverse bunny suit.","Meanwhile, a handful of artists had already posted the reverse bunny suits illustrations to Twitter and Pixiv by the middle of 2019. The oldest one on Pixiv was published by Onakaitai on August 14th, 2014.[5] On Twitter, Japanese mangaka Shake-O (鮭夫)[6] has posted rabbit girls wearing reverse bunny suits since 2016 (shown below). Also, illustrator and anime background art designer NYAGORO posted Ryuka Shimizudani from the Japanese manga Saki[7] in a reverse bunny suit in 2018. His tweet with the illustration, drawn in the drawing chat on Futaba Channel (2chan), suggested 2chan users hadn't been familiar with the idea of this outfit in that period.[8]    The online presence of reverse bunny suits began increasing around early 2020. At that time, people noticed some online artists posting the illustrations around on November 28th (11/28), December 8th (12/8), January 28th (1/28), February 8th (2/8), and March 28th (3/28) (shown below). Their works got inspired by ""Reverse Bunny Day,"" the unofficial holiday for the outfit which read the numbers of ""Bunny Day"" (8/2, 8/21, or 8/23) backward or referred to November 28th as ""Good Reverse Bunny Day"" in a similar way to ""Good Knee-High Socks Day"".     Early works posted around Reverse Bunny days till February 2020  Spread Throughout those unofficial anniversary days between the end of 2019 and early 2020, Reverse Bunny Suits gained high visibility on Twitter around the spring of 2020. That year's 3rd celebration on March 28th received much more reaction from Twitter users than in previous years. As its popularity grew on the social networking service, illustrators voluntarily began using censorship to hide nipples and crotch in the illustrations in a concern for community guideline violations or a shadowban[9] from the SNS. This slightly changed version came to the de-facto standard of the costume on Twitter[10], Nico Nico Seiga[11], and other online services that don't allow hentai artworks. On October 31st, 2020, the Japanese TV anime for the light novel How Not to Summon a Demon Lord[12] celebrated Halloween on Twitter with an illustration by Takahiro Tsurusaki (鶴崎貴大)[13], the illustrator for the light novel series, in which the anime's heroines are wearing reverse bunny suits in this format.[14] Pixiv had nearly 5,000 illustrations for this fetish costume only that year, and its amount had increased to about 10,000 by December 2022[15], in which almost 75% of the submissions were R-18. Cosplay costume makers started releasing reverse bunny suits in the latter half of 2020. Porn video makers soon introduced the costume into their works and have made it one of the most popular costumes in the Japanese porn industry since the following year. According to the Japanese e-commerce site for adult content, Fanza, the number of porn videos featuring the costume was four in 2020, then increased to 37 in 2021 and nearly 150 in 2022.[16] It also became popular in the non-porn content by sexy models and cosplayers, which usually combined the outfit with swimsuits or lingerie. Japanese model Aoi Hinata (日向葵衣)[17], who in a reverse bunny suit made an appearance in a weekly magazine released in December 2021, proclaimed herself the first gravure idol wearing the costume in commercial media by citing a publisher's testimony.[18] Various Examples       Search Interest     External References  [1] Pixiv Encyclopedia – 逆バニー [1] Nico Nico Pedia – 逆バニー [3] Pixiv Encyclopedia – 逆ビキニアーマー [4] Pixiv Encyclopedia – 逆スク水 [5] Pixiv – 反転バニーちゃん / 08-14-2014 [NSFW!] [6] Wikipedia – 鮭夫 (Japanese) [7] Wikipedia – Saki [8] Twitter – @nyagoro2001 / 03-19-2018 [9] Wikipedia – Shadow banning [10] Twitter –  逆バニー / #逆バニー [11] Nico Nico Seiga – 逆バニー (Japanese) [12] Wikipedia – How Not to Summon a Demon Lord [13] Wikipedia – 鶴崎貴大 (Japanese) [14] Twitter – @isekaimaou / 10-31-2020 [15] Pixiv – #逆バニー [16] Fanza – Search results for 逆バニー (Japanese) [NSFW!] [17] Wikipedia – 日向葵衣 (Japanese) [18] Instagram – @aoi_hnta / 10-16-2022",

For instance, on November 9th, 2022, the TikTok[4] account satissatuo posted its first ""pipe"" video, earning roughly 26,300 plays and 1,800 likes in one month (shown below).    @satissatuo #foryou #fyp ♬ Love You So – The King Khan & BBQ Show      On November 15th, 2022, a TikTok[5] uploaded by satissatuo and another TikTok[6] uploaded by daerthegay both used Family Guy and ""pipe"" videos. At the top of the comment sections for both read a blue, ""related search"" query reading, ""family guy pipeline incident"" (screenshots shown below).     The recommended search ""family guy pipeline incident"" was due to the dual visuals in the videos of the ""pipe"" video and the Family Guy clip. As the search started to be recommended in mid-November 2022, TikTokers started making content about it, wondering what it meant and what the ""incident"" was. On November 21st, 2022, TikToker[7] komipat posted the first known video to reference the search, gaining roughly 147,800 plays and 2,600 likes in two weeks (shown below).    @komipat #familyguy#fyp ♬ original sound – ZayZay and sum runtz       Family Guy Clip Jumpscares On November 20th, 2022, TikToker[8] popperball9 posted a Family Guy clip video that overlayed and inserted multiple shitpost style videos as a way of avoiding copyright claims in a meta manner.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent that makes me secretly burn a fire in my loins as I stand in the kitchen window watching him chopping wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Shohei. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.

The term is typically used to refer to one's opponents, with the common understanding being that the term ""opp"" stems from the word ""opposition."" The abbreviation grew in prevalence online in the late 2010s, with a slew of Chicago rappers and Chief Keef, in particular, helping to popularize the term after the year 2016.","According to Genius,[1] the earliest use of the word ""opposition"" in a rap song was in a 1985 track named ""Rock The Bells"" by rapper LL Cool J, where he says, ""Be forced to assault / Opposition will halt"" (seen below, left).[2] Another early use of the word ""opposition"" stems from the Dr. Dre song ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'"" where he says, ""But I ain't no politician, no competition / Sending all opposition to see a mortician"" (seen below, right).[3]","However, the earliest known use of the abbreviation ""opp"" stems from a more recent song by Chicago-based drill artist Chief Keef, in his 2011 track ""John Madden,"" in which he says, ""Better stop, fuck nigga we don't fuck with opps (Nah)."" The track can be accessed via upload to YouTube from October 30th, 2011,[4] where it gathered over 16 million views in 11 years (seen below).   Spread Other early uses of the word ""opp"" stem from Lil Reese, Chief Keef's contemporary at the time, in his track ""Us,"" in which he says, ""Fuck a opp, we send shots."" The track can be accessed via an April 4th, 2012, video uploaded to the YouTube[5] channel A Zae Production, where it gathered over 14 million views in 10 years (seen below, left). Chief Keef uses the word ""opp"" again in his track ""Citgo,"" which was uploaded to the YouTube[6] channel Homespun Media Group on August 15, 2013, where it gathered over 30 million views in nine years (seen below, right).     Use of the term ""opp"" in rap music remained largely minimal until 2016, after which the word exploded into popularity, primarily due to the increased virality of the Chicago drill music scene Chief Keef pioneered. Various rap artists like Travis Scott, [7] Playboi Carti, [8] Lil Uzi Vert [9] and others popularized the term in the latter half of the 2010s. The use of the word ""opp"" also entered mainstream slang during the late 2010s, with the earliest viral uses of the term appearing in 2018. Playboi Carti,[10] Lil Durk,[11] Cardi B[12] and Young Thug[13] notably tweeted using the word ""opp"" in 2018.

Sneako began posting to YouTube in 2013 and gained a significant following throughout the late 2010s for content including man-on-the-street segments like ""Would You Say the N-word for 1 Dollar"" and ""Why Men and Women Aren't Equal."" He also started a second channel, ""One Minute Podcast,"" where he would ask people for hot takes on often controversial subjects in public. Throughout the 2020s and during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sneako's content became increasingly controversial and was perceived as sexist, antisemitic and hateful by many. He also started to associate with figures like Andrew Tate, Tristan Tate and Nick Fuentes. In October 2022, his YouTube account was then terminated. In November, he met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago alongside Kanye West and Fuentes, who he also went to InfoWars with in December.","Sneako was born on September 8th, 1998, describing his upbringing as middle class, and attended private school during his youth. Sneako posted his first video to his now-deleted YouTube channel on April 9th, 2013. The majority of his early content featured Sneako ranting while playing video games like Call of Duty. Sneako claims he got his first YouTube AdSense check when he was 14 years old. In November 2015, Sneako uploaded a video titled ""How People View You,"" a motivational video where he talks about people's perceptions while cutting his hair. This was his first viral video (reupload shown below).[1][2]","After the success of the video, Sneako largely stopped making gaming content and started posting rants and videos about cultural, political and motivational topics. Sneako also became friends with MrBeast, who was purportedly a fan of his content. Sneako worked with MrBeast in 2018 but was fired after working on a single YouTube[3] video, ""I Built A Working Car Using Only LEGOS,"" leading to their falling out (shown below).   One Minute Podcast After the falling out with MrBeast in 2018, Sneako began the series ""One Minute Podcast,"" where he set up a table in public spaces and asked random passersby their opinions on controversial opinions, such as, ""do white lives matter?"" (reupload shown below).[1]  ""We Broke Up"" Video / D'angelo Wallace Feud In early 2021, Sneako uploaded a video titled ""We broke up"" to YouTube[4] where he interviews his ex-girlfriend and talked with her about why she broke up with him (reupload shown below). The two were in an open relationship but his ex-girlfriend seems unsure of that fact in the video. She says they broke up because of distance and because he cheated on her. Some commenters thought the video crossed a line and was too personal.  YouTuber D'Angelo Wallace commented under the video, ""he's for the streets."" Shortly after the comment, Sneako uploaded a video to YouTube[5] titled ""FORCING MYSELF TO WATCH D'ANGELO WALLACE"" in which he rants against Wallace while watching his video ""Influencer-19,"" where Wallace criticizes influencers for publically partying during the COVID-19 pandemic (reupload shown below). In the video, he makes fun of Wallace, derogatorily calls him gay and says Wallace is just jealous he wasn't invited to the parties. Prior to the video in late 2020, Sneako had made numerous tweets[6][7] downplaying the seriousness of the pandemic. D'Angelo never responded to Sneako's response. On March 18th, 2021, YouTuber Kuncan Dastner posted a video detailing the feud.  Sneako Cucked By Ex-Girlfriend In November 2021, Sneako appeared on the YouTube[8] podcast Peer to Peer Podcast and talked about his open relationship with his girlfriend. During the podcast, he describes a situation where he was cucked by his girlfriend, saying it felt like ""somebody was taking something"" from him as he watched her have sex with another man (shown below). Some people have joked and hypothesized that this contributed to his increasingly sexist opinions.  Reaction Content / Andrew Tate Throughout 2022, Sneako started delving more into livestreaming and reaction content. He also grew a liking for Andrew Tate and would frequently react to his content and parrot his claims on his second channel, SHNEAKO, where he posted most of his reaction content (now deleted). Sneako started to grow a following on TikTok[9] for compilation videos similar to those posted by Tate fans where he makes controversial, often sexist claims about women (examples shown below). He also started to regularly make fun of content creators with liberal beliefs.    @heartonmysleeve_ Sneako seen it all #prediction #sneako #fyp ♬ Can We Kiss Forever? – Kina       @sneako_page 👇 How Much Money Should a Gey make per Year? #sneako #sneakoclips #shneako #shneakoclips ♬ original sound – SNEAKO      Chad Chad Controversy In mid-2022, Sneako reacted to a video by creator Chad Chad. During the stream, he makes fun of Chad Chad's looks and blames her feminist viewpoints on the assumption that she hasn't had sex in a long time, making mock humping motions and a choking motion as he says, ""shut up with your feminist viewpoints.""  Sneako inspired controversy for the motions he made, with some saying they implied sexual assault. Sneako defended himself by calling the claims ""kink-shaming,"" saying that he likes rough sex and that he said she needs that, not that he wants to do it to her. The Creativity Kit In 2022, Sneako started a business called ""The Creativity Kit""[10] that has been compared to Andrew Tate's ""Hustlers University."" Essentially, The Creativity Kit offered paying members access to a course on how to make money online. YouTuber BSOLZ posted a video in August 2022 where he tries the Creativity Kit, criticizing it, garnering over 128,000 views in a year (shown below).  YouTube Channel Termination and Move to Rumble By September 2022, Sneako had two strikes on his YouTube channel. He began reacting to increasingly controversial, right-wing media figures, including people like Tucker Carlson, Steven Crowder and Nick Fuentes, also reacting to the documentary What Is A Woman. He also started creating content with Fuentes, inviting him on his stream where he pushed back against none of his anti-semitic or racist claims. On October 3rd, he was banned from YouTube.[11] On October 19th, he appeared on YouTube[12] on No Jumper with Fuentes to have a ""race debate"" (shown below).  Following his ban from YouTube, Sneako moved his livestreams and content to Rumble.[13] 2022 Mar-a-Lago Visit On November 25th, 2022, Sneako posted a photograph to Twitter[14] where he is seen with Kanye West and Milo Yiannopoulos before their visit with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago (shown below).    Feud With Cr1TiKaL In early November 2022, Sneako went on stream (shown below, left) to defend the hosts of the Fresh & Fit podcast after Cr1TiKaL posted a video making fun of a story they told on their show (shown below, right).[16][17]     On November 25th,  Cr1TiKaL posted a video to YouTube[18] where he discusses how Sneako has been criticizing him. In the video, he makes fun of Sneako for being sensitive. In particular, he shows clips of Sneako defending the movie Cuties after Cr1TiKal made a video denouncing it for its sexualization of children and shows clips of him talking about getting cucked.  Online Presence Sneako is currently active on Twitter[15] @TheSNEAKO and Rumble at sneakouniverse. Retrospectives / Calls for Ban Throughout 2022, YouTubers posted numerous videos calling for Sneako to be banned from the platform and making videos explaining how he had been delving more and more into controversial topics (examples shown below).

The slideshows became a cliché on the platform as people either found them cringy or relatable and made parodies of them that used more obtuse or aggressive clips and soundbites. Phrases like Slideshows Boutta Go Crazy or Slideshows Gonna Be Crazy started trending in anticipation of the sound's usage by depressed others.

There were no signs of forced entry and it is believed that the killing was a targeted attack. The investigation is ongoing and the murderer(s) have not been caught, with no suspects named by police as of November 30th. As the investigation went on, online sleuths, especially on Reddit and 4chan, began examining the evidence and attempting to dig up new leads to solve the crime. Some believe the murderer posted on Instagram under the name the_moscow_slayer and that they posted a photo of Goncalves to 4chan on the day of the killings. The photo is seemingly taken from outside a window in Moscow, Idaho and shows a girl's hair that some believe is Gonclaves, although these claims are unconfirmed.",,"On November 14th, FOX News[2] reported that the town's Mayor, Art Bettge, hypothesized, ""It’s one of any of a plenitude of possibilities, including burglary gone wrong, robbery gone wrong … any of those is a possibility and not one to the exclusion of others."" This was later found to be unlikely, as police believe it was a targeted attack.   Developments / Investigation November 14th, 2022 (Stabbing, Isolated Attack) On November 14th, 2022, FOX News[3] reported that the students were stabbed to death according to authorities. The report claims that no weapons were found on the scene, but they believe a knife was used. The report also shared a group photo of the four victims reportedly taken hours before the murders (shown below). Police believed it was an ""isolated and targeted attack"" and that the murderer or murderers are not a threat to the community.    November 15th and 16th, 2022 (Blood Oozing Through Walls, Press Conference) On November 15th, 2022, the Daily Mail[4] reported that the attack was so brutal that blood was left ""oozing through the walls"" of the home. One police source told the Daily Mail that it was ""the worst they’ve ever seen,"" saying, ""We have investigators who have been on the job for 20, even 30, years, and they say they have never seen anything like this."" The report also gives details of the investigation, sharing that police were going through trash cans close to the home to look for potential weapons and that Chapin's body was found on the second floor of the three-floor home. On November 16th, The New York Times[5] reported that the police had no suspect and shared photos of a candlelight vigil held for the students. That day, police gave a press conference giving all available details of the investigation up to that date (shown below). During the conference, Moscow Police Chief James Fry claimed that Chapin and Kernodle were at a party before they were murdered and Mogen and Goncalves were at a bar. Chapin did not live in the house but was visiting his girlfriend, Kernodle. There were two other roommates at the house when police arrived on the scene who were uninjured. Fry is unsure why the caller reported an unconscious individual rather than a quadruple murder. A reporter asked if the roommates witnessed the murder and Fry responded, ""I’m not going to go into what they shared."" The roommates were all allegedly part of ""Greek life on campus.""

On that day, Global News[7] reported that police had been ""reticent"" on releasing info on the murder and that parents and family members of the victims were critical of the police force's efforts for sharing so little information. November 18th, 2022 (Calls to Ex-Boyfriend Jack, Food Truck Video, Surviving Roommates Cleared) On November 18th, 2022, Fox News[8] reported that Goncalves' sister, Alivea Goncalves, claimed that Kaylee called a man named Jack six times between 2:26 and 2:44 a.m. on the night she was murdered. Between 2:44 and 2:52 a.m., Mogen reportedly called Jack three times. Kaylee allegedly called the man one more time at 2:53 a.m. Allegedly, this is Goncalves' ex-boyfriend and the Goncalves family is certain he was not the murderer.[19] That day, CNN[9] shared a video taken of two of the four victims, Mogen and Goncalves, at a food truck on the night of the murders at around 1:41 a.m. The food truck owner, Joseph Woodall, claimed they did not seem distressed in any way.  That day, ABC News[10] reported that the two surviving roommates were not believed to be the murderers. Allegedly, they slept through the murders, a fact that some Idaho police found hard to believe.[20] They also shared a map from the City of Moscow Police department offering a timeline of the whereabouts of the four students hours before the murders (shown below). That day, TMZ[21] reported that Xana fought back against the attacker.    November 19th to the 21st, 2022 (Stabbed to Death In Beds, Calls to Police) On November 19th, 2022, Global News[11] reported that the victims were stabbed to death in their beds and were likely killed in their sleep, according to the county coroner. The coroner reported that they were stabbed in the chest and upper body and there were no signs of sexual assault. On November 20th, ABC News[12] reported that ""other friends"" were in the house when the 911 call was made to the police at around 11:58 a.m., but they did not say how many. The call was reportedly made from one of the surviving roommates' phones. The surviving roommates were still not considered suspects. On November 21st, CNN[13] released a timeline of the investigation so far. November 22nd and 23rd, 2022 (Police Dispel Stalking, Skinned Dog Rumors) On November 22nd, 2022, The Guardian[14] published an article about the fear that the lack of evidence surrounding the case was causing. In the article, they share a message from Police Colonel Kedrick Wills, who said, ""We know that people want answers. We want answers, too."" Wills also discouraged people from ""spreading rumors"" about the case, including about suspects who have been ruled out. On November 23rd, Global News[15] published an article sharing a message from the police dispelling rumors that Goncalves was being stalked. They also dispel a rumor that a skinned dog found three weeks before the killings was related to the crime, the police saying it was more likely caused by wildlife. November 23rd to November 30th, 2022 On November 27th, 2022, ABC Chicago[16] released a summary of the investigation so far. On November 29th, ABC 6[17] reported that the father of Goncalves called on the public for help solving the case. On November 30th, the New York Post[18] reported that Jeremy Reagan, a ""socially awkward"" law student at U of I, denied claims that he was the murderer after people online allegedly started spreading the rumor. Online Reactions The case inspired condolences for the victims and calls for the murderers to be found. It also inspired a lot of internet sleuthing and hypothesizing as people poured over the evidence and searched for new leads on the case. Some people hurled accusations at potential suspects, including Goncalves' ex-boyfriend Jack, who Goncalves called six times shortly before the murder. Goncalves' family believes he is innocent (shown below, left). Amateur crime reporters and creators also gave summaries and opinions on the case, including Law & Crime Network (shown below, right).     4chan Posts On November 27th, 2022, an anonymous user of 4chan's /pol/[22] board began a ""University of Idaho Murder General"" thread in order to discuss the case and collect evidence relating to it. The thread includes photographs of a man who goes by dylanmm26 on VSCO seen with one of the victims, screenshots from a now-deleted Instagram account called the_moscow_slayer who followed the victims and posted an image of a knife that some believe to be the murder weapon (shown below, left) and an anonymous 4chan post claiming the killer is named Jack Showalter (shown below, right). One post from November 20th shared on the thread claims that the street where Showalter lives was closed off at one point. None of these claims are confirmed and may be false leads.     /r/IdahoMurders Subreddit The /r/IdahoMurders subreddit was created on November 17th, 2022, to discuss the ongoing investigation and is largely used to share potential leads on the case. The forum gained over 27,000 followers by November 30th. Some of the forum's top posts share disgust with some of the rumors and hypotheses being spread online and discourage amateur sleuths from jumping to conclusions.[23][24] On November 26th, a Redditor made a post on /r/IdahoMurders[25] claiming they saw two photos on 4chan the day of the murders — one of which they believe is Kaylee Goncalve in her bedroom taken from either outside the window or from in a closet. The other is all black as if taken in the dark. The user provides screenshots of the photos (shown below). One photo is labeled ""Step one."" One poster claims the anon posted the photos with weird messages the night of the murder along with coordinates that lead to a location near the crime scene. These reports are all unconfirmed and possibly unrelated to the case or fake.

The news was devastating for many Smash fans and competitors, several of whom had spent much of 2022 traveling to events across the globe in order to qualify for the Smash World Tour championships. The news led to a harsh backlash against Nintendo and especially Panda Global.",,"In their statement,[2] they explained that they believed they had a blessing from Nintendo to run their events so long as they did not use illegal game mods on Smash Brothers. They detailed the actions of Panda Global CEO Alan Bunney, which included purportedly threatening other independent Smash tournaments, including BTSSmash, saying they would not be able to operate in 2023 unless they joined the Nintendo-licensed Panda Cup. Ultimately, Nintendo told the Smash World Tour organizers that their circuit would be unable to run without a commercial license from Nintendo, which would not be granted for their championship finals and would not be granted in 2023, essentially saying they could no longer operate. They closed by saying they posted the letter in the hopes Nintendo would reconsider its decision.  To close, we ask that Nintendo reconsiders how it is currently proceeding with their relationship with the Smash community, as well as its partners. We are always open to continuing the conversation, and we hope we can be a part of the solution.   Developments The news was devastating for many Smash competitors, several of whom had spent 2022 traveling the world to attend Smash World Tour events. While the Smash World Tour statement did not explicitly blame Panda Global for Nintendo's decision, their section detailing the actions and purported underhanded threats of Alan Bunney towards other independent organizers led many to believe they had some influence over Nintendo's final decision. Twitter user and Melee player @AidenCalvin[3] expressed that he would never attend a Panda event again, accusing Nintendo of using Panda to choke out independent organizations (shown below, left). BTS Smash organizer @LDeeep[4] accused Bunney of ""running a protection racket"" by implying any independent tournaments would get shut down unless they joined the Panda Cup (shown below, right).     VGBC posted a document announcing they would cancel two of their planned events due to uncertainty about what Nintendo will allow.[8] Panda's content creators expressed great disappointment with the decision. Commentator TKBreezy, signed with Panda, went on his Twitch stream that night and began applying for jobs (shown below, top), though he said he had been applying for jobs for months before that night.[5][6] Also on November 29th, 2022, Panda player ESAM[7] wrote on his Twitter, ""I want to see the most opportunities for smash possible. This is fucked"" (shown below, bottom).      Many also made memes, often at Panda's expense. For example, Twitter user @braeden_kb2 posted a Wesley Snipes Crying meme on November 29th about Panda creator Coney, gaining over 800 retweets and 9,600 likes in one day (shown below, left). Parody account @PandaGolbal then posted a meme mocking a typical Panda YouTube thumbnail about the controversy, gaining over 1,200 retweets and 6,900 likes in one day (shown below, right).     Nintendo gave a statement to Kotaku[9] that it had not urged Smash World Tour to cancel the 2022 finals considering the time and player energy that had already been put into the circuit, but Smash World Tour organizers stated this completely contradicted what Nintendo had told them verbally and in writing. On December 2nd, Nintendo and Panda both released statements alleging that VGBC had canceled the 2022 Smash World Tour of their own volition and were not ordered to by Nintendo, contradicting what VGBC said in their statement. Both statements were thoroughly mocked on social media. Dr. Alan eventually resigned as CEO of Panda. Dr. Alan's Statement On December 6th, 2022, Dr. Alan released a 31-page statement refuting the allegations against him. He claimed Smash World Tour intentionally sabotaged its 2022 championships in order to bring Panda down and rally the community behind it. VGBC, the organizers of Smash World Tour, disputed this in a statement of their own, saying they had little to gain and far more to lose by canceling their marquee 2022 event.

(Japanese: 後藤さんちんぽデカいのね～, Gotō-san Chimpo Dekai no ne-) is a phrase uttered by a Twitter user imitating the voice of Ikuyo Kita from a TV anime for the Japanese manga Bocchi the Rock!. In November 2022, one dirty vocal impersonation formed a concept, sometimes dubbed ""Ecchi the Fuck!"" (えっち・ざ・ふぁっく!), ""Erect the Rock"" (ぼっき・ザ・ロック, Bokki the Rock), ""Big Dick Gotō Hitori"" (デカマラ後藤ひとり, Deka Mara Gotō Hitori) or ""Futanari Gotō"" (後藤ふたなり), among Japanese Twitter users and hentai fans, even though the original media franchise has never presented such a thing.","On November 10th, 2022, a female Twitter user, Mustard (マスタード, @rituakaPAKOPAKO), posted a video titled ""An imitation of Bocchi the Rock!"" (shown below). In the video, she impersonated the voices of Ikuyo and other Kessoku Band members who found that Hitori Gotō, or Bocchi, had a large male organ. She declared in another tweet that this video, a parody of a scene in the 3rd episode, where Ikuyo said that ""Gotō-san, You're good at guitar!"", got inspired by illustrations and streamings by a hentai artist Toriyarou (トリヤロウ)[1] a few days before.[2] Also, Nijika's part is a parody of a similar rendition in the anime's promotional online radio program, Bocchi the Radio!. The video tweet had played 1 million times while earning 12,000+ retweets and 42,900+ likes by the end of that month.","ぼっち・ざ・ろっく！のモノマネ pic.twitter.com/pxRMpjcInF — マスタード (@rituakaPAKOPAKO) November 10, 2022   Transcripts Ikuyo: Kandoh!

Two days later, she added another impersonation replicating a reply she received (shown below), and these posts became fodder for MAD videos on Niconico.[4] Those videos were not so many but exuded an odd presence in fan creations for the anime, tagged under its name[5] or ""Bocchi the MAD!""[6], on the video-sharing service and boosted the spreading of the hentai concept, Bocchi has the D, on Twitter with various ridiculous names above.[7]  これが下北沢のツチノコ(意味深)ですか… pic.twitter.com/REOi3XN8C5 — マスタード (@rituakaPAKOPAKO) November 12, 2022   Transcript Ryo: Bocchi no Chimpo… Bocchimpo… Nijika: Omoshiroi!
